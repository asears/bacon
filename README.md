# Rock Paper Scissors
I'm modifying the *Daddy or Chips? Google Home Action* example from Glitch to play Rock Paper Scissors.


It's based on Google's example [API.AI Webhook Template for Actions](https://github.com/actions-on-google/apiai-webhook-template-nodejs) project.

## Getting Started
To get started you need to:
- Set up an API.ai account
- Create a new project on Google Cloud
- Then build out your app's logic in API.ai

For more detailed setup instructions, see `setup.md`.
